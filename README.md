## 📂 Project Structure

The code is organized topic-wise in folders:

```

📦 DSA-Company-Exam-Sheet
┣ 📂 array
┃ ┣ 📜 1_smallest.py
┃ ┣ 📜 2_largest.py
┃ ┣ 📜 ...
┃ ┗ 📜 array.md
┣ 📂 numbers
┃ ┣ 📜 1_is_palindrome.py

## ▶️ How to Run

Make sure Python is installed, then run any file like:

```bash
python numbers/3_is_prime.py
````

(or)

```bash
python array/1_smallest.py
```
